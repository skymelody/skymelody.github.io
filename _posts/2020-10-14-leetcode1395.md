There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.
You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:
Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
A team is valid if:  (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

Examples:
```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1).
```
思路：
对于每个元素，统计左边比他大的和比他小的，统计右边比他大的比他小的。ans += (leftMin x rightMax) + (rightMax x rightMin)
```cpp
int numTeams(vector<int>& rating) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < rating.size() - 1; ++i) {
        int leftMin = 0, leftMax = 0, rightMin = 0, rightMax = 0;
        for (int j = i-1; j >= 0; --j) {
            if (rating[i] > rating[j]) ++leftMin;
            else ++leftMax;
        }
        for (int j = i+1; j < rating.size(); ++j) {
            if (rating[i] > rating[j]) ++rightMin;
            else ++rightMax;
        }
        ans += (leftMin*rightMax) + (leftMax*rightMin);
    }
    return ans;
}
```
