Given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr.
In one step, you can select any non-empty sub-array of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.
Return True if you can make arr equal to target, or False otherwise.

Examples:
```
Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.
```

思路：
排序，如果两个数组经过排序后是相等的，那么肯定可以通过reverse子数组使其相等
```cpp
bool canBeEqual(vector<int>& target, vector<int>& arr) {
  sort(target.begin(), target.end());
  sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
  return target == arr;
}
```
